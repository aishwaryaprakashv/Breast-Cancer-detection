Here, we first analyze the dataset of Breast cancer detection by checking the first 5 rows as well as the complete columns name.
Then we just check for null_values in each column.
Then will go for splitting the training and testing dataset at 25% size of testing dataset and rest for training.
We scale the dataset using StandardScaler()
We go for creating a model using Logistic Regression, using training dataset.
Testing the accuracy of model.
